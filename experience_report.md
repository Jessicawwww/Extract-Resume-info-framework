# Experience Report

First of all, the README file is quite detailed, concise, and easy to understand. 
It's friendly for users to get started with. The data-plugin and display-plugin loading process is also easy. 
The team is supportive when providing technical assists. 
I was having issues runing 'npm start' as it keeps throwing errors.
I opened a git issue about this problem and the supporting team replied me quickly to discuss about the issues.
We talked about several solutions such as different node.js versions and I finally solved it under their guidance quickly.
I also asked about how to load display plugins and they responded quickly to clarify that as long as my plugin file is under plugin folder,
I don't need to do anything more.

Overall the experience is good and I appreciate their help.
